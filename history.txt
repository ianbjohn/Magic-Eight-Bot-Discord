1.10 - 8/23/19
-Changed the way memes are added - Instead of pushing and then sorting, it inserts into the already-sorted list, improving the time to O(n).

1.09 - 8/23/19
-Improved the code quite a bit. Made it more JavaScript-y.
-Improved logging in with the token by having it be read from a file instead of hard-coded into the program.

1.08 - 9/11/18
-Added a new !fortune command to let the user know their luck for the day

1.07 - 9/8/2018
-Fixed a bug with !addmeme so that now it'll only register if !addmeme is at the beginning of the message
-Made the bot randomly react messages with random reactions

1.06 - 7/8/2018
-Changed the linear search on the list of memes to a binary search to make speed better as the list continues to grow.
-Translated the strcmp() function from the C standard library into javascript, since I couldn't get localeCompare() to cooperate with sort().
-Added a developer !test command to make sure binary search works as intended.

1.05 - 7/7/2018
-Added an !addmeme command, which will add a meme to the list of memes, unless it's already been added. The channel will be notified as such by the bot.

1.04 - 7/6/18
-Added a !meme command, which will send a random inside-meme to the chat from a text file.
-Cleaned up code a bit (It could still use work as it's pretty clunky-looking)

1.03 - 7/5/18
-Added a !roll command, which generates and sends as a message a random number between 0-999999999, used for various things.

1.02 - 1/24/17
-removed the feature I added last version where you HAD to ask it a question

1.01
-Made it so that a message to the bot needed to end in a ?, otherwise the bot would reply in a snarky tone telling you to ask a question.

# MagicEightBot - Discord

Inspired by a similar bot made for Kik, this is a simple magic eight ball bot I made for a Discord server me and my friends are in.
https://discordapp.com/ It has since grown to do other things, such as send random inside-jokes and tell your fortune.

I wrote this as a challenge to get used to working with the Discord API, as well as familiarize myself with Node.js (Used to make the Discord.js module.)

Me and my friends have had many laughs using it, and it's solved many internal issues / disputes between us.
